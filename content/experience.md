### Summer Internship at INESC-ID GSD
The goal was to use transactional memory support from the new Haswell processors to execute device drivers code in an isolated way (sandboxed) inside the kernel. My responsibility in this project was to develop ASM code in order to test the executability of this concept.  


# Education
I have a bachelor's and master's degree in Computer and Informatics Engineering with specilization in Games and Interaction and Visualization from Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon. My master's thesis intitled "Multi-dimensional player skill progression modelling for procedural content generation" was about a Multi dimensional adaptation model in a context of a video game that procedurally generates content based on the player skill progression. This work featured, in the form of a full paper, in the International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games (FDG 18) in Malmö, Sweden. The research paper is available at the ACM digital library [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3235765.3235774#URLTOKEN#) and the dissertation [here](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/meic-a/dissertacao/1972678479054615).
