<h3 class="job-title"> <span class="job-title-bulletpoint">></span> Technology Software Developer</h3>
<span class="job-company">Miniclip </span> • <span class="job-dates"> 02/2020 - 04/2023</span>

I led the development and upkeep of the Unity technology for Miniclip's suite of mobile games. My role involved crafting in-house tools and libraries to enhance our game development workflows. While I initially contributed to the development of an internal telemetry C++ SDK universally adopted by Miniclip titles, a significant portion of my role revolved around refining the Unity engine pipeline. I played a key role in optimizing and creating tools for an internal asset management system leveraging Addressables technology. I held the position of technical owner for vital technology modules, including asset management and configuration. I also served as the go-to person for several technology modules, ensuring seamless operation and enhancements to critical components. These efforts significantly contributed to the success of games such as 
Volleyball Arena [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/volleyball-arena/id1563362742)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miniclip.minivolley),

and Horse Racing Hero [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miniclip.horsey)/[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/pt/app/horse-racing-hero-riding-game/id1626987074).

<span class="job-company">Miniclip </span> • <span class="job-dates"> 06/2018 - 04/2020</span>

I began my journey working on Agar.io Mobile for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/agar-io/id995999703)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miniclip.agar.io), a world famous hit I contributed to the development of features like the VIP subscription. Shortly after, I transitioned to the Mini Militia development team, a free-to-play 2D shooter game for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/doodle-army-2-mini-militia/id405885221) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appsomniacs.da2). During this phase, I played a crucial role in the comprehensive overhaul of the game. The entire game UI was rewritten, and the underlying technology was updated to leverage Miniclip’s internal core tech.

The goal was to utilize the transactional memory support introduced by the Haswell processors to execute device driver code within a secure, isolated environment in the kernel. My role in this project involved developing assembly code to evaluate the feasibility and functionality of this concept.

# Education

I hold both a bachelor's and master's degree in Computer and Informatics Engineering with a specialization in "Games Interaction and Visualization" from Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon. My master's thesis, titled "Multi-dimensional player skill progression modeling for procedural content generation", explores a multi-dimensional adaptation model in the context of video games that procedurally generates content based on player skill progression. This research was presented as a full paper at the International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games (FDG 18) in Malmö, Sweden. The research paper is available in the ACM digital library [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3235765.3235774#URLTOKEN#) and the dissertation [here](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/meic-a/dissertacao/1972678479054615). I was advised by Professor Carlos Martinho.
