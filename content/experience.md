The objective was to leverage the transactional memory support provided by the new Haswell processors to execute device driver code within a secure, isolated environment within the kernel. My role in this project involved the development of assembly code designed to assess the feasibility and functionality of this concept.

## Education

I hold both a bachelor's and master's degree in Computer and Informatics Engineering with a specialization in "Games Interaction and Visualization" from Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon. My master's thesis, titled "Multi-dimensional player skill progression modeling for procedural content generation", explores a multi-dimensional adaptation model in the context of video games that procedurally generates content based on player skill progression. This research was presented as a full paper at the International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games (FDG 18) in Malmö, Sweden. The research paper is available in the ACM digital library [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3235765.3235774#URLTOKEN#) and the dissertation [here](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/meic-a/dissertacao/1972678479054615).<br>
