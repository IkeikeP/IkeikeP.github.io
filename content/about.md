Hey, my name is Francisco Bicho and I am a Game Developer based in Lisbon, Portugal.

I am from a very small town located in the center north region of Portugal. This is a remote, almost uninhabited area where the chances of surival were slim.
I had to scavange supplies and shelter everyday to survive the wilderness and harsh environment. Aright this is actually bullshit but I kinda wish it was true.

OR

I hail from a teeny-tiny town nestled in the center-north region of Portugal. While it might sound like I battled the wild and survived on my wits, it's all just a fun exaggeration – though I admit, sometimes, I wish it were true!


Originally from Covilhã, a small city in the central region of Portugal. I hold a bachelor's and master's degree in Computer and Informatics Engineering from Instituto Superior Técnico. Currently, I am working at Miniclip as a Sofware Developer on the Core Technology team.

Computers and especially games have been my passion for as long as I can remember. Video games definitely defined a part of my identity. I consider myself a curious person and so, I am eager to learn all new types of technologies.
Additionally (and possibly not surprisingly) I have a special interest for Japan and its incredibly rich culture.
